<h1 style="font-size: 55px;">Bianic Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="bianic_policy">
    Effective Date: September 13th, 2023
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1 class="bianic_header_policy" > Contact Us </h1>
<p class="bianic_policy">
    If you have any questions or requests regarding your personal data or how we store it - we encourage you to contact us using the email address provided below.
<p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1 class="bianic_header_policy" > Data We Store Locally On Your Device </h1>
<h2 class="bianic_subheader_policy" > Data You Provide Us Directly </h2>
<p class="bianic_policy">
    - Binance api and secret key are stored securily and encrypted on the device.
</p>
<p class="bianic_policy">
    - The cryptos that you want to use in your rebalancing portfolio.
</p>

<br>
<br>

<h1 class="bianic_subheader_policy" > Data From Your Binance Account </h1>
<p class="bianic_policy">
    What cryptocurrencies you have and information about them - like their amount and price.
</p>

<br>
<br>

<h1 class="bianic_subheader_policy" > Data Calculated By Bianic </h1>
<p class="bianic_policy">
    - Generated Reports: your portfolio statistics at some time. Like what amount of total USD you have, how many of each coin you need to buy/sell. We store up to X of those reports(currently 30(13.09.2023), this number may change) and old reports are deleted.
</p>
<p class="bianic_policy">
    - Exceptions Log: Bianic's feature to help you identify problems. Mostly contains app-related data like that you didn't fill your Binance keys, but may contain also events caused for some features in Bianic to fail(for example that at Date X, time Y, we were unable to contact binance because of missing internet connection). As with the Generated Reports, old data is deleted and we store only 30(13.09.2023) most relevant records.
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1 class="bianic_header_policy" > Data Collected from your device </h1>
<p class="bianic_policy">
    We, as VippyGames, collect no data from you. Zero, nothing.
</p>

<br>
<br>

<h1 class="bianic_subheader_policy" > Data Shared With Third Parties </h1>
<p class="bianic_policy">
    We send data to Binance only and only from Bianic. We send the needed information for binance to process our request and return a response to make the app and it's features work. We send your Binance API key attached to the requests to Binance, ecrypted of course.
</p>
<p class="bianic_policy">
    Currently(13.09.2023), we perform only the following requests:
    <br>
    <br>
    - Get the information about all your coins in the account.
    <br>
    * Shared data: API key.
    <br>
    <br>
    - Get price of coins in USDT.
    <br>
    * Shared data: API key, the coins to get.
</p>

<p class="bianic_policy">
    Data that those requests were performed, with additional information about them like time, your device's IP, web request headers may be stored on the Binance side. Please contact Binance if you are interested in retrieving/deleting this information.
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h1 class="bianic_header_policy" > Your Rights And Options </h1>
<h1 class="bianic_subheader_policy" > Push Notifications </h1>
<p class="bianic_policy">
    As Bianic can work and track coins in background if you configure it to do so, we notify you about important events using push notifications.
</p>

<p class="bianic_policy">
    Those events include:
    <br>
    <br>
    - That we check your coins in background
    <br>
    <br>
    - The threshold rebalancing percent you configured has been reached
    <br>
    <br>
    - Exception occurred: like no internet connection and Bianic can't check coin stats.
</p>

<p class="bianic_policy">
    You can manage the shown notifications to you using notification channels. You may also disable them entirely, although it is not recommended if you want Bianic to track coins in background - as Bianic won't be able to notify you of important events.
</p>

<h1 class="bianic_header_policy" > Final Words </h1>
<p class="bianic_policy">
    That's all, and remember, if you have any questions you can always contact us using the mail specified below.
</p>
<p class="bianic_policy">
    Good Luck Investors!
